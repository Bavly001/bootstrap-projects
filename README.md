# Bootstrap project  
=====================

This project challenge was to do all projects using bootstrap only without styling using CSS  
  
So, this project contains two HTML files one for the Student form and the other for the Laptop store  
  
**Both of them designed only by bootstrap**

## Student form :memo:
  
The first HTML file is for the student form that contains the validation using the `was-validated` class by bootstrap.

## Laptop store :computer:
  
The second one is for the laptop store that justified and aligned correctly using `row` and `column` classes by bootstrap to set the website correctly.
